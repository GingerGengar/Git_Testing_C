Objectives of learning git

Setting a profile on git
To list all variables in the profile:
    git config -l
Git has system profiles, global profiles, and local profiles.
System profiles apply to all users and are written in /etc/git
Global profiles apply to just a specific user and is written in ~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config
Local profiles only apply to a single project and is written in .git/config at the repository root
The local profiles override the global profiles and the global profiles override the system profiles. So, if the local profile does not exist, the global profile is used. If the global profile does not exist then the system profile is used.
Git needs an email and a name.
To modify the user name in the global profile
    git config --global user.name "GingerGengar"
To modify the email in the global profile
    git config --global user.email "GingerGengar123@gmail.com"
One can modify the user name in the local profile
    git config --local user.name "GingerGengar"
One can modify the email in the local profile
    git config --local user.email "GingerGengar123@gmail.com"
To see the name, currently
    git config user.name
To see the email, currently
    git config user.email
