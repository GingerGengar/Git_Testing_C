Objectives of learning git

Setting a profile on git
To list all variables in the profile:
    git config -l
Git has system profiles, global profiles, and local profiles.
System profiles apply to all users and are written in /etc/git
Global profiles apply to just a specific user and is written in ~/.gitconfig or ~/.config/git/config
Local profiles only apply to a single project and is written in .git/config at the repository root
The local profiles override the global profiles and the global profiles override the system profiles. So, if the local profile does not exist, the global profile is used. If the global profile does not exist then the system profile is used.
Git needs an email and a name.
To modify the user name in the global profile
    git config --global user.name "GingerGengar"
To modify the email in the global profile
    git config --global user.email "GingerGengar123@gmail.com"
One can modify the user name in the local profile
    git config --local user.name "GingerGengar"
One can modify the email in the local profile
    git config --local user.email "GingerGengar123@gmail.com"
To see the name, currently
    git config user.name
To see the email, currently
    git config user.email

Make commits on git
Git has an intermediate place called the staging area before commits are made.
To stage files,
    git add file1 file2
Alternatively, staging all files except for the ones in the gitignore,
    git add *
To make staging area finalized in a commit, say
    git commit -m "Give a helpful message on the git commit"

Restore old versions
To see all the history of the git commits,
    git log
To see the git commits pertaining to specific files
    git log file1.txt file2.txt
To restore a particular file to the last commit available,
    git checkout HEAD file.txt
To restore files from some commit
    git checkout COMMIT_NAME file1.txt file2.txt
